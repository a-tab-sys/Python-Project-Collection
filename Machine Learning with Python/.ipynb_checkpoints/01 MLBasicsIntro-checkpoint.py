# HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF A ML PROJECT
# 1. Import the data
# 2. Clean the data
# 3. Split data into training/test sets
# 4. Create a model
# 5. Train the model
# 6. Make predictions
# 7. Evaluate and improve - finetune parameters

# LIBRARIES COMMONLY USED
# Numpy - provides multi dimesional array
# Pandas - data analysis library that introduces concept of data frame. a data frame is a 2 dimensional data structure, similar to an excel spreadsheet
# MatPlotLib - 2 dimensional plotting library for creating graphs on plots
# Scikit-Learn - Most popular ML library that provides common algorithms like decision trees, neural networks, etc

#ENVIROMENT SETUP
# Jupyter is commonly used for ML projects. Helps with visualizing data, can be very messy in terminal. Also allows you to run isolated parts of a program.

# Go to anaconda prompt and type "jupyter notebook" - this will start the notebook server on your machine. a browser window will open pointing to local host, port 8888. this is the jupyter dashboard. on this dashboard we have a files tab that points to our home directory.

#Everytime you want to create a new notebook. Go into the home directory and somewhere on your machine click new, select that you want to create a new notebook, specity lang.
